Our main goal with this project was to develop a technological tool capable of transforming the way assets are managed within the institution. We aimed to create a practical, agile, and reliable solution that not only saves time and reduces errors but also significantly improves the organization and control of institutional resources.

Before presenting the results, it is important to explain the concept of asset management. It involves the process of cataloging, monitoring, and organizing an institution's assets to ensure control, optimize resources, and increase transparency. The objective is to maximize the use of assets, reduce waste, and facilitate decision-making. Furthermore, effective management ensures compliance with internal policies and provides greater security in asset traceability.

  <div id="justification-content">
    <p>The theme of developing an asset management software is highly relevant to SENAI, given the volume of assets and the complexity of maintenance and control operations. Automation significantly reduces the time spent on manual management while improving accuracy and minimizing human errors common in traditional methods.</p>
    <p>A centralized system enables real-time resource monitoring, facilitating strategic decision-making and efficient equipment allocation. This results in increased productivity, reliable management, and long-term cost savings through reduced waste, effective preventive maintenance, and better utilization of existing assets.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the system enhances the security and traceability of assets, reducing risks of loss and ensuring compliance with internal auditing and transparency policies.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this asset management software aligns with SENAI's strategic goals by promoting innovation, operational efficiency, and resource sustainability.</p>

  <div id="scrum">
    <h3>Scrum</h3>

<div id="trello">
  <h4>Trello</h4>
  <p>We use Trello to organize and divide the project into clear stages, making it easier to assign tasks and track progress. We create boards to represent the project and lists to organize the phases or categories. Within each list, cards are assigned to team members with defined responsibilities and deadlines. As tasks progress, we move the cards between lists, ensuring a clear overview of the projectâ€™s status and enabling efficient collaboration among team members.</p>

  <p>We adopt the agile methodology Scrum in our workflow, which, combined with Trello, provides a structured and collaborative approach to efficiently and transparently manage projects. Scrum is a methodology that aims to deliver high-quality results in short, continuous cycles, through an iterative and incremental approach. It is based on sprints, daily meetings, and a clear definition of roles and responsibilities, which facilitates communication, adaptation, and focus on project goals.</p>

  <p>In our case, Trello plays a crucial role in organizing and visualizing the workflow. We use Trello to divide the project into clear stages, which correspond to the sprints in Scrum. We create specific boards for each project and lists representing different phases of the cycle, such as "Backlog," "In Progress," "Under Review," and "Completed." This way, we can visually and intuitively track task progress, ensuring that everyone on the team knows exactly where they stand and what needs to be done next.</p>

  <p>Within each list on Trello, the cards represent specific tasks or features to be developed, and are assigned to team members with defined responsibilities and deadlines. Trello allows us to easily track the progress of each task by moving the cards between lists as activities advance, according to the Scrum workflow. This visual and dynamic approach facilitates task management, allowing everyone to see the priorities and deliverables of each sprint clearly and in an organized manner.</p>

  <p>Trello, combined with the Scrum methodology, also facilitates constant review and adaptation, key features of Scrum. After each sprint, we hold a retrospective meeting, where we evaluate what went well, what needs improvement, and what can be adjusted for the next cycle. Trello provides an overview of what has been done, allowing the team to focus on specific areas of improvement and adjust the action plan for the next sprint in an agile way, without overburdening the members.</p>

  <p>In summary, the agile methodology Scrum, combined with Trello, provides us with a structured and efficient way to manage projects, ensuring fast, continuous, and high-quality deliveries. Trello helps visualize task progress, facilitates communication and team adaptation, and allows for transparent and dynamic project management aligned with Scrum principles. This approach enables us to quickly respond to changes and continuously optimize our processes to achieve better results in each development cycle.</p>

  <h1>Architecture</h1>

  <h5>General Description</h5>
  <p>In general, the software discussed here aims to streamline the process of asset verification, along with other functions such as maintenance notifications, asset registration, filtering by room (for easy asset location), QR code scanning to obtain asset information, as well as providing actions like: notifying asset location (if it is not in its designated room), notifying damage (for maintenance purposes), adding assets (special permission), and editing asset information (special permission). The expected benefits from the implementation of this software include increased speed, prevention of damages, and additional cost savings.</p>
  
  <h2>Architectural Style</h2>
  <p>The architecture of our software follows the MVT (Model, View, Template) pattern of Django. The model contains the logical structure of the project and acts as an intermediary to manipulate data between the database and the view. In the model file, the data types and how they will be stored in the database are defined. The view controls the logic that determines how the data is presented to the users, formatting the data coming from the database via the model for display. Finally, the template is responsible for the visualization part for the end user. It is like the front-end of the application. This layer stores HTML, CSS, and extended JavaScript files, which helps in faster development. Based on the application's response, it renders the HTML files in the browser. Templates allow the presentation layer to be separated from the business logic, making it easier to maintain and update the application's design.</p>
