Our main goal with this project was to develop a technological tool capable of transforming the way assets are managed within the institution. We aimed to create a practical, agile, and reliable solution that not only saves time and reduces errors but also significantly improves the organization and control of institutional resources.

Before presenting the results, it is important to explain the concept of asset management. It involves the process of cataloging, monitoring, and organizing an institution's assets to ensure control, optimize resources, and increase transparency. The objective is to maximize the use of assets, reduce waste, and facilitate decision-making. Furthermore, effective management ensures compliance with internal policies and provides greater security in asset traceability.

  <div id="justification-content">
    <p>The theme of developing an asset management software is highly relevant to SENAI, given the volume of assets and the complexity of maintenance and control operations. Automation significantly reduces the time spent on manual management while improving accuracy and minimizing human errors common in traditional methods.</p>
    <p>A centralized system enables real-time resource monitoring, facilitating strategic decision-making and efficient equipment allocation. This results in increased productivity, reliable management, and long-term cost savings through reduced waste, effective preventive maintenance, and better utilization of existing assets.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the system enhances the security and traceability of assets, reducing risks of loss and ensuring compliance with internal auditing and transparency policies.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this asset management software aligns with SENAI's strategic goals by promoting innovation, operational efficiency, and resource sustainability.</p>

<div id="programming-languages">
  <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
  
  <div id="python">
    <h3>Python (Version 3.12.4)</h3>
    <p>Python is widely used for automation and web development, offering simplicity and extensive library support for backend and frontend integration. Its resource efficiency makes it ideal for environments with limited hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi, used to host this solution.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="javascript">
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript enables advanced functionality in web pages, such as dynamic content updates, interactive maps, or 2D/3D animated graphics. It forms the third layer of standard web technologies alongside HTML and CSS, ensuring modern and engaging user experiences.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="typescript">
    <h3>TypeScript</h3>
    <p>TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that adds static typing and other features, making it powerful for developing large applications. It allows developers to define types for variables, parameters, and function returns, improving error detection during development. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with browsers and environments that support only JavaScript.</p>

<div id="framework">
  <h2>Framework</h2>
  
  <div id="django">
    <h3>Django</h3>
    <p>Django is a framework that helps you develop web applications quickly and efficiently. Most web applications have common features, such as authentication, database querying, and cookie management. Django simplifies this by bundling these functions into reusable modules, making development more efficient and significantly reducing web development time.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="react-native">
    <h3>React Native</h3>
    <p>React Native is a mobile app development framework that allows developers to create native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to write most of the code in JavaScript while still generating native user interfaces, leveraging the components and APIs of each platform. The main advantage of React Native is the ability to reuse much of the code across platforms, saving time and resources in mobile app development.</p>
