Our main goal with this project was to develop a technological tool capable of transforming the way assets are managed within the institution. We aimed to create a practical, agile, and reliable solution that not only saves time and reduces errors but also significantly improves the organization and control of institutional resources.

Before presenting the results, it is important to explain the concept of asset management. It involves the process of cataloging, monitoring, and organizing an institution's assets to ensure control, optimize resources, and increase transparency. The objective is to maximize the use of assets, reduce waste, and facilitate decision-making. Furthermore, effective management ensures compliance with internal policies and provides greater security in asset traceability.

  <div id="justification-content">
    <p>The theme of developing an asset management software is highly relevant to SENAI, given the volume of assets and the complexity of maintenance and control operations. Automation significantly reduces the time spent on manual management while improving accuracy and minimizing human errors common in traditional methods.</p>
    <p>A centralized system enables real-time resource monitoring, facilitating strategic decision-making and efficient equipment allocation. This results in increased productivity, reliable management, and long-term cost savings through reduced waste, effective preventive maintenance, and better utilization of existing assets.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the system enhances the security and traceability of assets, reducing risks of loss and ensuring compliance with internal auditing and transparency policies.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, this asset management software aligns with SENAI's strategic goals by promoting innovation, operational efficiency, and resource sustainability.</p>

<div id="programming-languages">
  <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
  
  <div id="python">
    <h3>Python (Version 3.12.4)</h3>
    <p>Python is widely used for automation and web development, offering simplicity and extensive library support for backend and frontend integration. Its resource efficiency makes it ideal for environments with limited hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi, used to host this solution.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="javascript">
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript enables advanced functionality in web pages, such as dynamic content updates, interactive maps, or 2D/3D animated graphics. It forms the third layer of standard web technologies alongside HTML and CSS, ensuring modern and engaging user experiences.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="typescript">
    <h3>TypeScript</h3>
    <p>TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that adds static typing and other features, making it powerful for developing large applications. It allows developers to define types for variables, parameters, and function returns, improving error detection during development. TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with browsers and environments that support only JavaScript.</p>

<div id="framework">
  <h2>Framework</h2>
  
  <div id="django">
    <h3>Django</h3>
    <p>Django is a framework that helps you develop web applications quickly and efficiently. Most web applications have common features, such as authentication, database querying, and cookie management. Django simplifies this by bundling these functions into reusable modules, making development more efficient and significantly reducing web development time.</p>

  <div id="react-native">
    <h3>React Native</h3>
    <p>React Native is a mobile app development framework that allows developers to create native iOS and Android apps using JavaScript and React. It enables developers to write most of the code in JavaScript while still generating native user interfaces, leveraging the components and APIs of each platform. The main advantage of React Native is the ability to reuse much of the code across platforms, saving time and resources in mobile app development.</p>

  <h2>Markup Languages</h2>
  
  <div id="css">
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used to describe the presentation of documents written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements are displayed on screen, paper, or other media. It is one of the key open web languages and is standardized in web browsers according to W3C specifications.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="html">
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic building block of the web. It defines the structure and meaning of web content. Other technologies, like CSS and JavaScript, are typically used to describe the presentation and behavior of a web page.</p>

<div id="methodology">
  <h2>Methodology</h2>

  <div id="scrum">
    <h3>Scrum</h3>

    <div id="trello">
      <h4>Trello</h4>
      <p>We use **Trello** to **organize** and **divide** the project into clear stages, making it easier to **assign tasks** and **track progress**. We create **boards** to represent the project and **lists** to organize the phases or categories. Within each list, **cards** are assigned to team members with defined responsibilities and deadlines. As tasks progress, we move the cards between lists, ensuring a clear overview of the projectâ€™s status and enabling efficient collaboration among team members.</p>

      <p>We adopt the agile methodology **Scrum** in our workflow, which, combined with **Trello**, provides a structured and collaborative approach to efficiently and transparently manage projects. Scrum is a methodology that aims to deliver high-quality results in short, continuous cycles, through an iterative and incremental approach. It is based on **sprints**, **daily meetings**, and a clear definition of roles and responsibilities, which facilitates communication, adaptation, and focus on project goals.</p>

      <p>In our case, **Trello** plays a crucial role in organizing and visualizing the workflow. We use Trello to **divide the project into clear stages**, which correspond to the **sprints** in Scrum. We create specific **boards** for each project and **lists** representing different phases of the cycle, such as "Backlog," "In Progress," "Under Review," and "Completed." This way, we can visually and intuitively track task progress, ensuring that everyone on the team knows exactly where they stand and what needs to be done next.</p>

      <p>Within each list on Trello, the **cards** represent specific tasks or features to be developed, and are assigned to team members with **defined responsibilities and deadlines**. Trello allows us to easily track the progress of each task by moving the cards between lists as activities advance, according to the **Scrum** workflow. This visual and dynamic approach facilitates **task management**, allowing everyone to see the priorities and deliverables of each sprint clearly and in an organized manner.</p>

      <p>**Trello**, combined with the Scrum methodology, also facilitates **constant review and adaptation**, key features of Scrum. After each sprint, we hold a **retrospective meeting**, where we evaluate what went well, what needs improvement, and what can be adjusted for the next cycle. Trello provides an overview of what has been done, allowing the team to focus on specific areas of improvement and adjust the action plan for the next sprint in an agile way, without overburdening the members.</p>

      <p>In summary, the agile methodology **Scrum**, combined with **Trello**, provides us with a structured and efficient way to manage projects, ensuring fast, continuous, and high-quality deliveries. Trello helps visualize task progress, facilitates communication and team adaptation, and allows for transparent and dynamic project management aligned with Scrum principles. This approach enables us to quickly respond to changes and continuously optimize our processes to achieve better results in each development cycle.</p>

  <div id="notion">
    <h3>Notion</h3>

    <p>We use **Notion** to **organize information**, **manage tasks**, and **collaborate efficiently** as a team. We create **custom pages** to store notes, documents, and important data, along with **task lists**, **Kanban boards**, and **calendars** to track project progress. Notion also allows us to create **structured databases**, making information organization visual and accessible. With its flexibility and collaborative features, Notion has become our central tool for managing both day-to-day tasks and more complex projects.</p>
